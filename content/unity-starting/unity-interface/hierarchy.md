# The Hierarchy
The hierarchy window shows us a list of all of our GameObjects in a scene. It's a one-dimensional view of the scene, represented as a list.

It also is where we can group GameObjects together by dragging and dropping them. This is called “parenting”. It’s not just a visual organizational tool, it can have a major impact on how objects in the scene behave.

See the official [manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) on the hierarchy window.
