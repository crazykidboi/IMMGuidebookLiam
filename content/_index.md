## Everybody

This site is an open repository for guides, videos, and general technical references related to crafting immersive digital experiences. This site is focused on technical how-to. It is not a repository for design notes or concepts. The exclusion of design concepts should not be taken as a remark on it's significance, but merely a focus of this repository.

## IMM 215

This site is IMM215's repository for programming lectures. The lectures are freely available online for all. They are categorized by content, which may not map to course content in a day-day or topic-topic manner. It is organized to be generally accessible. For example, as a reference you can look back to in the future. See the course content for topic due-dates and course-specific information.
