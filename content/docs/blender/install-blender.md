# Installing Blender
You can always download and install the latest stable release of Blender at [blender.org](https://www.blender.org/).

## Blender Launcher
Only if you want to use brand new or experimental features (at the time of writing, new Geometry Nodes), you may want to explore different development branches of Blender. Dealing with multiple versions of Blender on one machine can be annoying. The best way to do this is with a piece the open source software [Blender Launcher](https://github.com/DotBow/Blender-Launcher).

Blender launcher will download and manage different blender versions, and easily let you change shortcuts/file associations for them.
