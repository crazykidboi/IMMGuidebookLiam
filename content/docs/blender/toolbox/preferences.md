Here are the settings that I prefer to change for Blender. Open the preferences by going to **Edit > Preferences**.

## Interface

**Interface > Menus > Open on Mouse Over.** I find this feature helpful during mouse-only operation.

## Viewport
Display > 3D Viewport Axis Size. I set mine axis size to be easier to see, easier to check my orientation at a glance. Although I use 1440 and 4k monitors.

## Keymap
The F3 button opens a menu-search popup in Blender, which is a life-saver. If you don't have a f-row (or, as with many laptops, your f-row is media keys by default, requiring you to hold the 'fn' button down to use), **and** you aren't doing animation in Blender, then it can be very helpful to have the spacebar open search.
