# Quick Tips.

## Use The Tilde (~) Key for Camera Control

The ~ key gives you the camera control options that also live on the number pad.
If you don't have a numpad, don't worry - ~ (usually to the left of the number 1 on a keyboard) will help you.

## F9 For Adjust Last Operation

Many operations give you a little menu to edit their specifics with, in the bottom left corner of the viewport.

Every Blender user knows that it goes away a little too easily - clicking off the selection, and just like that the menu is gone! Don't hit Undo just yet. Instead, press the F9 key. (or go to Edit > Adjust Last Operation). This will open the menu back up! All is not lost!

## Create a Loop Cut on any Object

- Hit K to bring out knife tool then select desired point.   
- Click z (for z axis, can do any desired direction) + c  
- Click outside of object in both directions to make cut
