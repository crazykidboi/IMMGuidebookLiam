# Unity

This section is for programming-heavy topics that are more specific to the Unity game engine, like tricks or extending the editor. 

For general Unity Development, see the [Unity]({{< ref "docs/unity" >}}) section.

For some useful development patterns in Unity, check out the [Unity Development->Toolbox]({{< ref "docs/unity/toolbox" >}}) section.

There is a lot of overlap, and I am trying my best to keep the programming-first concepts (that cover Unity) in the programming category, and the unity-first concepts with programming in the Unity category. It's not ideal, but I hope it works well enough.
