## Download Application
For this walk through I will be using Processing which can be found on [Processing](https://processing.org/). All you need to do is download the application and extract it into a separate folder. Once you finish downloading the application, you can start learning how to do processing through the extensive amount of tutorial videos available to you which can be found on [Processing Tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials).
## Tutorials
- A good tutorial to start learning processing with is the Coding Train, [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/guides/getting-started#start-learning-and-coding).
- The coding train is very beginner friendly and will teach you without expecting youn to know anything. You are presented the very basics and work your way up. 
- On this tutorial page there are also a bunch of other fun tutorials that you can follow along and make cool images. 

## Website
Another option that is available is to do processing form the website version. This requires less of a hassle is easier to set up if you want something quick.  
 - [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/)  
 
This method still contains everything you need to follow through the tutorials and learn. 

## Documentation
If you're having trouble finding the function you need to manipulate your image, use the documentation page available to you. It is updated and well organized so it is a very helpful and convenient tool to utilize. 
- [Reference Documentation](https://processing.org/reference/)
- [Environment Documentation](https://processing.org/environment)
- [Libraries Documentation](https://processing.org/reference/libraries)
- [Tools Documentation](https://processing.org/reference/tools)
 
 

## Debugging
If you are unable to launch Processing and your computer is saying that you installed a trojan virus, you are fine. There are multiple ways to go about solving this issue, listed below are the simplest ways with more listed at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Troubleshooting).
- Disable ad blocker on your computer for the processing applications
- Uninstall and reinstall the application
- Send in a report to windows

All three methods are explained in more detail at the website linked above. If none of these methods are working, you can always use the website and it should work.
