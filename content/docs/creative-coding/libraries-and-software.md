# Creative Coding Libraries and Frameworks

You can do 'creative coding',in just about any software system or tool. Yet, you want to work in an appropriate framework. Creative Coding libraries/frameworks tend to be sets of functions or systems built in an existing programming language, that you can simply use.

openFrameworks and processing are perhaps the most well known and influential frameworks, but there is no need to default to just downloading processing or learning C++. Finding a framework that exists in a language that you are familiar, and is convenient to use for your desired output.

# Code Libraries
As much as possible, I have linked not to the home or 'getting started' pages to the following projects, but to the about page, where you can usually read about why the creators of the library felt it was necessary to create - as opposed to using another one that already existed. Understanding the goals of the software will help you gauge it's likely strengths. 

- [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/about/) (C++)
- [Processing](https://processing.org/overview) (Java)
- [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/) (Python)
- [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) (JavaScript)
- [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) (C++)
- [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org/) (Kotlin)
- [Klak](https://github.com/keijiro/Klak) (Unity/C#)
- [nannou](https://guide.nannou.cc/why_nannou.html) (Rust)

# Shader Editors
- [KodeLife](https://hexler.net/kodelife) Real-time GPU shader editor
- [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) - Web Community & Tool
- [GSNComposer](https://www.gsn-lib.org/) - Visual Web Tool for Shaders
- [SHADERed](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed) - Shader Writing Software


Visual shader plugins exist inside of engines like Unity ([Amplify](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-editor-68570), [Shader Weaver](https://www.shaderweaver.com/), and [Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@11.0/manual/Getting-Started.html)) and Unreal Engine ([Material Editor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/Materials/Editor/)
