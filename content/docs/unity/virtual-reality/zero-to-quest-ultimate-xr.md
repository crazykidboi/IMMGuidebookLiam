### Overview

 0. Make sure Android is added as a build target for the appropriate version of Unity. You can do this in the Unity Hub. Go to Installs, click the gear icon next to the appropriate version of Unity, and choose "Add Modules". Add Android Build Support, and the JDK, SDK, and NDK tools.

 1. Go to [UltimateXR](https://www.ultimatexr.io/) and click on the download link below the "Watch Teaser" button.  

 2. Open a new project in 3D (URP), you may need to download it. DO NOT download the sample scene option.

 3. After your project opens, go to File, Build Settings at the bottom of the drop down and click on the Android icon in the platform area. Click **Switch Platform** in bottom right.
