## How to Use Ultimate XR

Now that UXR is added to the URP Unity project and the settings have been corrected, what do you do now?

1. Go to the UltimateXR folder now added to the unity assets window. 
2. Go to the *Prefabs* folder, selects *Avatars*, and then select one of the three avatar assets provided to you.

3. Drag the prefab into the hierarchy and make the position 0,0,0. This will make things easier for you when moving around/coding for your experience.

4. Completely unpack the prefab.

5. Make it your own prefab in a separate folder.

6. **Don't worry** if you look at the game view and see that the camera is in the ground/object. This is how it should look. When you enter the scene via VR, the camera will adjust and be the correct height.

7. That's it. Everything should be ready for when you deploy to the quest!

- For further things to do with the UXR plug-in, reference the documentation to learn about grab poses, smooth locomotion, teleportation, grabbable objects, etc.
