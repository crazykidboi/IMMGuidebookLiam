title: UltimateXR UI Options
draft: false
---

There are two options available when interacting with UI options in UXR. That is the *UXRFingerTip* and *UXRLaserPointer*. 

## Set-up
Setting up your UI with UXR is fairly simple. The first thing you need to do is add a Unity Event system to your scene by going to *GameObject --> UI --> EventSystem*.

Once you have your event system added to the scene, add the UXR Pointer Input Module component. The good thing about this component, is that when you hit play mode, any canvas that works in World Mode will automatically have the UXR Canvas components added to it.

Otherwise, you will manually add the UXRCanvas component. 

# Avatar Setup

## UXR Avatar
The UXR Avatar automatically comes with both laser's and fingerstip UI manipulation. By default **fingertips are enabled and lasers are disabled.** To enable the lasers just turn them on in the hierarchy.

## Custom Avatar
### Fingertip
In order to enable the fingertip interaction, you need to add the component **UXRFingertip** to the index finger of each hand (standard placement). You can also use a game object (empty game object) that is attached to the finger tip.
