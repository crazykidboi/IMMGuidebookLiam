# The Intro Lectures

These are recordings of in-class lectures I give about Unity. I hope most of this website will get to the point where Unity information is not hidden in these hour-long videos to reference, but It is still important for me to have the lectures proper recorded and online. They are not about a "easy win" or first "fun" project, and you won't necessarily have the confidence to _do_ much afterwards, but I am working on building out a solid foundation of knowledge to build on top of, so to speak. 

The purpose is to give you the knowledge that makes teaching yourself Unity easier.

These are not lectures designed for video, they are designed for mostly-listening students who are clicking away in Unity while I talk. What's more: in video format I have expanded room for some more detail than I usually go over, as I don't spend time walking around the room and letting students practice. Thus: sorry about the long-winded and rambling nature (but not really). 

If you don't know where to start, and are starting from scratch, you can start here.

A slow introduction to writing your first component. Follow along with this one.

## Your First Assignment
The next step is to step away from long videos, and just poke around in Unity. Here is your first assignment: Make a level for your roll-a-ball.

Practice creating and moving GameObjects, manipulating the scene view, and creating assets (materials). Enter play mode and try rolling the ball through the level, then go back and change things. Try changing the balls mass, angular drag, or other physics settings.
