# Python Fundamentals

Much of the guidebook content in this section was created while teaching an Introduction to Programming course.
These videos are largely small topics-supplementing content, and not designed to stand alone.

## Other Resources
### Books

The textbook for the class, [Practical Programming](https://pragprog.com/titles/gwpy3/practical-programming-third-edition/) is a great resource. ([alibris](https://www.alibris.com/Practical-Programming-An-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-Using-Python-3-6-Paul-Gries/book/39047737)).

Also great is the [Python Pocket Reference](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-pocket-reference/9780596802042/), which can get you to accurate reference faster than the time it takes to filter through bad google results.

### Videos
- [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) has been consistently producing high quality educational content, and has great processing and python series.
