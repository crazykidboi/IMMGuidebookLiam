# A Handful of Computer Tips
These tips are generally about the Windows operating-system, or common conventions that many pieces of software use. 

- Underlined letter in a menu tells you the shortcut to select that menu item
- Menu's usually tell you the keyboard shortcut to perform that action without a mouse
- Workspaces
- Moving a cursor of text around
- Opening and Navigating a file explorer (without using the mouse) will help you organize your files
- Many number entry boxes let you perform simple arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) in them.
- Quickly switch between windows with alt+tab or cmd+tab
- Launch software quickly with Win+ or Cmd+Space launchers (alt+space with powertoys)
- Open the windows "Quick" menu with Win+X. Don't try this, but on Windows 10, "Win+X, U, U" will quickly shut down your computer. 
- Speaking of shortcuts not to try, Win+L will lock your computer.
- Lets take a look at properties and details of the file menu.
- Win+P to open external connected display options
- View your file system visually, using software like WinDirStat, TreeSize, GrandPerspective, or others. I have been using WinDirStat for 15 years and won't switch now.
- Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V will paste text without formatting, usually.
- Ctrl+L (cmd+l) will select and highlight an address bar or search bar in most software (like web browsers and file explorers)
