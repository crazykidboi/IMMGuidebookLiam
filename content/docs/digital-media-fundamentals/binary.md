# Binary
'binary' Refers either to [binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) or [binary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code), both of which are base 2 representations of information. We can do math with binary numbers, and store data (inclding numbers) with binary code, also called binary encoding.
