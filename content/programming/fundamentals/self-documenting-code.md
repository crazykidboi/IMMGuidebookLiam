title: Self Documenting Code
draft: true
---
If we recall, I often describe code as a compromise between humans and computers. We have some parts that are more for humans - like comments, that computers ignore entirely, and other parts that are more for computers - like having to end our statements with semicolons when to me the end is obvious, from the line break.


Self documenting code is code written with care to the human side of things. Naming ones functions and variables in such a way that we don't _need_ as many comments.
