# Data-oriented Design
I think one of the best introductions to pragmatic data-oriented design is the 2017 talk that Ryan Hipple gave at the Unity Connect conference. It also introduces the basics of ScriptableObjects.

After you have watched the above video, I recommend checking out the asset [ScriptableObject-Architecture](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/scriptableobject-architecture-131520) on the asset store. It's an implementation of the ideas of the above talk, but really nicely done. It's [open source too](https://github.com/DanielEverland/ScriptableObject-Architecture).
