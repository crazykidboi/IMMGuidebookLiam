# Singletons

## Prerequisites

Understanding [Static Objects]({{< ref "/csharp/advanced/static-objects-and-unity.md" >}}) and having a solid grasp of [object oriented principles]({{< ref "/csharp/advanced/object-oriented-programming.md" >}}) is a prerequisite for being able to effectively use the Singleton pattern.

In my opinion, singleton patters are great for single-scene games, but cause trouble once we start having to load, unload, or manage multiple scenes. I much prefer other approaches over singletons, like scriptableObjects.
