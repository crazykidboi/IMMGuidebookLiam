title: Visual Creative Coding Tools
---

Often, the procedure involved with creating visuals can be modeled like a flow chart. Many visual editors use a flow-chart paradigm to give users a visual and script-less way to create procedural output.

In particular, shaders - programs that define colors and light reflections in a 3D rendering engine - are well suited to being turned from a visual flow-chart into performant code. 

Outside of shaders and visual coding, dedicated tools like TouchDesigner allow for an incredible degree of flexibility and complexity when creating visual effects.

TouchDesigner is a professional tool used to run visuals for things like events, sports stadiums, art galleries, and more. See the work page of [SudoMagic](https://www.sudomagic.com/work/#highlights) for a wide array of ways this tool can be used.

Visual shader editors also exist inside of 3D engines.  

Unity has [Amplify](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-editor-68570), [Shader Weaver](https://www.shaderweaver.com/), and it's officially supported [Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@11.0/manual/Getting-Started.html).
Unreal Engine has [Material Editor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/Materials/Editor/), Godot has [Visual Shaders](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.html), and Snapchat's Lens Studio has a [Material Editor](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/learning-lens-studio/graphics/materials/material-editor/material-editor-templates/material-editor#guide).
