Also called pascalCase.\nYou cannot start a variable with a number.\nC# requires that we declare the variable type. We can\u0026rsquo;t just say \u0026ldquo;let x be some variable. A number? A word? I dunno, you figure it out\u0026rdquo;. You can think of types as letting the compiler know how to interpret the sequence of bits (1s and 0s) that the variable is storing. Does 01011001 refer to the 8-bit binary number 89, Or the ascii character code for \u0026ldquo;Y\u0026rdquo;? In every programming language, the computer needs to know, and in C# it\u0026rsquo;s our responsibility to tell it.  Common data types are: string, int, float, bool, char.\nDeclaring data variables: #  public string weUseCamelCase;//Variable names uppercase every word except the first, and cannot start with numbers. We do not use snake_case. private int someNumber = 4;//you set values during declaration bool isAwesome = true; //The scope is \u0026#39;private\u0026#39; by default, so we don\u0026#39;t have to type \u0026#39;private\u0026#39;.  Data Structures #  Declaring structs is very similar to regular variables. We just use the type of the struct for the type: private Vector3 someVelocity; public Quaternion rotationStorage; Vector2 inputDir;\nWhere it differs is how we create structs. Structs use the same constructor/deconstructor syntax as classes. We type \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; then the type name, followed by parenthesis, and then we put our appropriate values in the parenthesis like parameters to a function. Vector3, the most common struct we use in Unity, takes 3 float values for its x, y,and z values in that order.  private Vector3 someVelocity = new Vector3(0,0,3);//0 on the x axis, 0 on the y axis, 3 on the z axis. Vector2 inputDir = new Vector2(-1,0); Vecto2 newInputDir = inputDir;//We don\u0026#39;t need to create new variables, we can copy other structs values. Vector3 otherDir = Vector3.right;//Here we copy a built-in variable, see below.  Vector3.right is a shorthand, its basically an already existing variable thats equal to Vector3(1,0,0). In the above example, we simply copied these values into our variable. Vector3.right (and the other short-hands) are much easier to type than \u0026ldquo;new Vector3(1,0,0)\u0026rdquo;, and makes the code easier to understand when reading it..  Declaring Classes #  The syntax for variables that store a class (or a reference to an instance of a class) is the same as structs. \u0026ldquo;private Thing something = new Thing();\u0026rdquo; There is just one notable exception: They do not have default values. When you declare a class, it will be null. We have to either set it equal to a new instance of the class. ( =new Thing() )\nFunctions #  Functions are also called methods in C#. There are pedantic differences, and these pedantic differences can differ between languages. I don\u0026rsquo;t want students to worry about it. We will use the terms \u0026ldquo;method\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;function\u0026rdquo; interchangably.\nSome programmers will be mad at me for this, so I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the 1 sentence version: In C#, \u0026lsquo;Function\u0026rsquo; is a more broad term for \u0026lsquo;things that include executable code\u0026rsquo;, where methods are a type of function. Other functions that aren\u0026rsquo;t methods include constructors, properties, indexers, events, and operators.  The Syntax for a function is simple. Just like variables, we start with the scope (public/private), then the return type, and then the function name (CapitalizedCamelCase). What makes a function a function (syntactically speaking) is parenthesis. They follow the function name without a space.\nThe parenthesis hold are \u0026lsquo;arguments\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;parameters\u0026rsquo;, but even when we don\u0026rsquo;t have any arguments, we still need the parenthesis. The () is how we can always recognize a function. After the parenthesis we put curly braces, which contain the code that makes up our function.\n [scope][space][returnType][space][FunctionName][(parenthesis)][{curlyBraces}]\nscope returntype functionName(){}\n private void Start() { //Code here, indented. } Creating Functions With Parameters #  To pass data into a function, we declare variables inside of the parenthesis. We declare them like a regular syntax for declaring a variable (without scope), inside of the parenthesis, separated by commas. They can only be used inside the function.\nVariables created this way are called \u0026ldquo;parameters\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;arguments\u0026rdquo;.  private void GiveMeSomeNumbersToWorkWith(int a, int b) { //This code now has two integer variables to work with, a and b. } private void GiveMeOtherInformation(string words, int andANumber) { //This function has been given a string variable and an integer variable. } private void GiveMeOtherInformation(float someNumber) { //This function has the same name as the above function. This is allowed so long as the paremeters are different. } Functions with the same name but different parameters are allowed in C#. We would say it has a different \u0026ldquo;method signature\u0026rdquo;. One would expect the functions to do the same thing. This is a way of writing the same function multiple times, except to allow for different types of input from the parameters. We have seen this with the \u0026ldquo;Instantiate\u0026rdquo; function from the intro roll-a-ball lesson.\nTake a look at the documentation for the Instantiate function built into Unity. Notice it has a number of different declarations.\n Indentation and spacing #  While C# does not care about your indentation, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about extra white-space, there are a set of standards that developers follow. It\u0026rsquo;s important for everyone on the same team to follow the same conventions, also called \u0026ldquo;standards\u0026rdquo;. Jetbrains Rider has a common set of standards built-into it, which are customizable. Setting up your IDE to use the same standard you follow makes it really easy.\nI recommend starting curly braces on a new line, and indenting code inside of curly braces. This way, one can draw a vertical line straight down from where a curly brace starts. If we see any other code at that indentation level, we can quickly identify that either 1) we need to indent it, or 2) we have messed something up. It makes seeing your code structure easy, which makes it easier to find bugs.\nIf statements do not need curly braces. If they don\u0026rsquo;t have one, they will automatically execute the single next line. This is a shorthand, and I do not recommend you follow it when you start coding. It is easier to make mistakes when you code isn\u0026rsquo;t formatted consistently. You have to remember that just these one-liner if statements are special. I say: don\u0026rsquo;t bother.\nWhatever standard you prefer, just remember to be consistent.\n//C# Does not care about line breaks. private void Start(){} //C# Does not care about line breaks. private void Start() {//We put the first curly brace on a new line \t//we indent every line of code inside of the curly braces \tif(something == true) { //Some other code inside curly braces, indented again. \tDebug.Log(\u0026#34;something is true.\u0026#34;); } }//the closing curly brace is at the same indentation as the first one, so we can tell which ones go with which. \nCalling Functions #  To execute a function, we just type the name of the function followed by parenthesis, and a semicolon. Just like any other statement in C#\nprivate void Start() { SayHelloWorld(); } private void SayHelloWorld() { Debug.Log(\u0026#34;Hello, World\u0026#34;); } \u0026ldquo;Executing\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Running\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Calling\u0026rdquo; functions are all perfectly fine ways to refer to the same thing: make it do it\u0026rsquo;s thing.  If the function has parameters, we pass those in, in order, separated by commas. We can type the values directly, or use a different variable whose value or reference will be passed along.\nprivate void Start() { SayHelloToMe(\u0026#34;World\u0026#34;);//prints \u0026#34;Hello, World\u0026#34;  string myName = \u0026#34;Abby\u0026#34;; SayHelloToUs(myName,\u0026#34;Ben\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Chris\u0026#34;)//prints \u0026#34;Hello Abby, Ben, and Chris.\u0026#34; } private void SayHelloToMe(string yourName) { Debug.Log(\u0026#34;Hello, \u0026#34; + yourName); } private void SayHelloToUs(string a, string b, string c) { Debug.Log(\u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34;+a+\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;+b+\u0026#34;, and \u0026#34;+c+\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;); } "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/programming/architecture/the-architecture-lecture/","title":"The Architecture Lecture","section":"Architecture","content":"The Architecture Lecture\n  "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/unity/unity-fundamentals/project-basics/","title":"Unity Project Basics","section":"Fundamentals","content":"Unity Project Basics #    "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/programming/fundamentals/conditionals/","title":"Conditionals","section":"Fundamentals","content":"Conditionals #  A conditional is something that can be true or false.\nBoolean #  The simplest conditional is a \u0026ldquo;boolean\u0026rdquo; data type. A boolean is a variable that can be equal to either \u0026ldquo;True\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;False\u0026rdquo;, and Nothing else. They are stored as a single bit, a 1 or a 0, so they literally, can only be true or false.\nIn C#, and in most programming languages, this data type is called \u0026ldquo;bool\u0026rdquo;.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;Boolean\u0026rdquo; comes from a mathematician named George Boole.  private bool trueOrFalse;//false by default. private bool isAmazing = true; We often use \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;are\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rdquo;, and similar prefixes in our variable names. (such as \u0026ldquo;bool isCool;\u0026quot;). This naming helps us read the code, it is grammatically easy to understand that this variable is something true or false.  Conditional Operators #  Booleans are great for storing something that is true or false, but they don\u0026rsquo;t help us dynamically determine if something is true or false (You know, the thing that makes computers more special than calculators). For that, we need operators.\nYou are probably familiar with mathematical operators:\n plus: + minus: - multiplication: * division: \\   In programming, an operator is like shorthand syntax. It\u0026rsquo;s a symbol with data on either side of it. It takes the left and right side of the operator, and then turns the whole thing into a new data value. The \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; operator takes two numbers to either side of it, mathematically adds them together, and returns the new single number of whatever their sum is.\n Conditional operators returns a bool. Common conditional operators:\n Greater Than: \u0026gt; Less Than: \u0026lt; Greater Than or Equal To: \u0026gt;= Less Than or Equal To: \u0026lt;= Is Equal To: == Is Not Equal To: !=  Pay attention to the \u0026gt;= and \u0026lt;= operators. We cannot flip around the greater than or equal to symbols. =\u0026gt; and =\u0026lt; are different symbols that mean something else. For example, =\u0026gt; is a \u0026lsquo;lambda operator\u0026rsquo;, and that would be gibberish to the compiler in the context of a conditional. So you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with an error.  Also note the == operator. In C# programming, one equal sign (=) will very specifically take the right-hand value and assign it to the left hand side. Two equals signs (==) will compare the left-hand and right-hand sides, and then evaluate if they are equivalent or not. They are used in completely different ways.\nUnfortunately, in english, we say \u0026ldquo;equals\u0026rdquo; for both of these different things. I recommend you read \u0026ldquo;==\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;Is Equal To?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo;.\n Logical Operators #  Logical Operators are used to connect multiple conditionals together to form another greater conditional. Like all operators, they consider the information to their left and their right (in this case bools), and they give us a new value, another bool.\nLogical Operators:\n And: \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Or: || Not: !  The | is the \u0026lsquo;pipe symbol\u0026rsquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s often located above the enter key on keyboards. OR is two pipe symbols: ||.  The AND operator will return true if either side of it are both true. If one or both of them are false, then it will be false.\n true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; true == true true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; false == false false \u0026amp;\u0026amp; true == false false \u0026amp;\u0026amp; false == false  The Or operator will return true if one or both of its sides are true.\n true || true == true true || false == true false || true == true false || false == false  Why two ampersands? Or two pipe symbols? It turns out you can use single ones too.\nThe operator evaluates either side of it. The code on the left evaluates first, then the code on the right. For an AND operator, if the left side is true, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what the right side is. The double \u0026amp;\u0026amp; and double || versions of the operator will not evaluate the right-hand side if it isn\u0026rsquo;t needed. This is more efficient code, and considered good practice. As a rule of thumb, you should use it by default.\nRead about them in the official documentation.\nKnowing this, we can write conditionals in a way that evaluates simple parts before complicated ones. Like first checking if the right button is pressed (simple) before doing a physics/raycast calculation to see if the space is open to move into (complex). if(RightKeyIsPressed() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ComplexFunctionToCheckIfWeCanMoveRight()){}. If the right key isn\u0026rsquo;t pressed, the \u0026amp;\u0026amp; symbol means we won\u0026rsquo;t bother even calling the complex function.\n  Boolean Algebra #  Of course, we can combine conditional operators and logical operators in complicated ways. When we do so, we can use parenthesis to disambiguate our order of operations, just like PEMDOS in algebra. We evaluate in parenthesis first, then left-to-right. See the official documentation for operator precedence, but I recommend you default to using parenthesis to disambiguate, instead of relying on knowing the order of logical operations. It may technically be unnecessary, but if you err on the side of writing readable code over concise code, you\u0026rsquo;ll have fewer bugs.\nSee Syntax of Code Flow for an explainer of if statements, the most common use case for conditionals.\nint a = 4; if(a \u0026lt; 5 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; a \u0026gt; 0) { //a must be 1,2,3,or 4 for this code to run. } int a = 4; int b = 5; bool runAnyway = true; if((a \u0026lt; b \u0026amp;\u0026amp; b == 7) || runAnyway) { //a must be less than b and b must be exactly 7, or runAnyway is equal to true. } Not #  Also called the \u0026ldquo;Logical Negation Operator\u0026rdquo;. A ! placed before a conditional will negate it, flipping it from true to false and from false to true.\n! is not an operator in the way I described operators above, with a left and right side. It\u0026rsquo;s more of a prefix. It\u0026rsquo;s still called an operator in the programming syntax sense of a symbol that has a special purpose and function.\n !true == false !false == true !(a == b) and (a != b) evaluate the same  The ! symbol is called \u0026ldquo;bang\u0026rdquo;, which is much easier to say than \u0026ldquo;exclamation point\u0026rdquo;.  //Hypothetical jump code for some game bool inTheAir = !CheckIfGrounded(); //We read this part as \u0026#34;if JumpKeyIsPressed And Not inTheAir\u0026#34;. //This is almost grammatically coherent. Naming variables and functions in this way can make your code easier to understand if(JumpKeyIsPressed() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !inTheAir) { Jump(); } Bonus: Exclusive Or. #  The or function is true if either value is true, but what about when we want only one value to be true? In english, we would still use the word \u0026ldquo;or\u0026rdquo;, in the world of logic, we need to be more specific and disambiguate. So: \u0026ldquo;Exclusive Or\u0026rdquo;. The exclusive or operator will be true so long as one and only one of the two values are true.\nThe exclusive or operator is the ^ symbol.\n true ^ true == false true ^ false == true false ^ true == true false ^ false == false  "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/programming/fundamentals/syntax-of-code-flow/","title":"Syntax of Code Flow","section":"Fundamentals","content":"Code Flow #  Inside of functions, there are a number of different ways to change how code executes. Without messing with code flow, and just having a bunch of statements, code will execute top to bottom, left to right. Code flow is how we get more complicated.\nThere are 2 main ways to manipulate code flow: Branches and Loops.\nBranches, which will likely never be referred to as \u0026ldquo;branches\u0026rdquo; again, are a way of executing functions only in some situations. We have two main forms: The If Statement and Switch Statements. Lets ignore switch statements for now, and focus on the if statement.\nStatement #  A statement is an action of a program. Usually, a single line of code is a statement. We generally end our statements with semicolons. Statements are the code doing some single thing.\nDeclaring a variable? Thats a statement. Assigning it a new value? That\u0026rsquo;s a statement.\nStatement Blocks #  Any code inside of curly braces could be considered a block, or statement block. We contain a number of statements inside some curly braces, and now we can put multiple statements, wrapped up in curly\u0026rsquo;s, and treat it like one statement from the outside.\nThe If Statement #  The If statement takes a conditional and will only execute statment if the conditional is true.\nThe syntax is: the word if, followed immediately by parenthesis that contain a conditional. The code will execute or not execute the statement that follows it depending on the conditional. if(conditional == true) DoSomething();\nExcept, you should basically never write your if statements without using a statment block \u0026ndash; curly braces. We use a curly braces basically 100% of the time. The above is valid, and considered a shorthand, but we want our code to be consistent and readable. So, in practice, the syntax of an if statement is:\nThe keyword \u0026lsquo;if\u0026rsquo;, followed by parenthesis that contain a conditional, immediately followed by curly braces.\nif(conditional == true) { DoSomething(); } The If-Else Statement #  The \u0026lsquo;else\u0026rsquo; keyword can be added to after the if statement to provide some code that will only happen if the conditional is false. It\u0026rsquo;s like an \u0026ldquo;otherwise\u0026rdquo; clause.\nif(conditional == true) { DoSomething(); } else { DoADifferentThing(); } if(conditional == true) { DoSomething(); } else //programmers will fight over the appropriate line spacing of the else statement. I have no strong opinions. { DoADifferentThing(); } You can chain if-else statements together if(inputDir == Vector2.left) { MoveInDir(Vector2.left); } else if(inputDir == Vector2.right) { MoveInDir(Vector2.right); }else if(inputDir == Vector2.up) { MoveInDir(Vector2.up); } else if(inputDir == Vector2.down) { MoveInDir(Vector2.down); }else { StopMoving(); }\nLoops #  Loops allow us to execute a statement block multiple times.\nThe simplest loop is the while loop.\nThe While Loop #  It\u0026rsquo;s basically the same syntax as a simple if statement, but with the keyword while.\nSo long as the conditional is true, the code in the blocks will execute.\nwhile(true) { //The word \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; is always true, so this code will run over and over again forever and crash your computer.  //This is called an infinite loop, and every programmer has made this mistake at least once. } We can use a while loop and an integer to build a simple counter. int i = 0;//A while(i \u0026lt; 10)//B { //Some code we want to run multiple times.  Debug.Log(i); i = i + 1;//C } //This will spit out 0 - 9 in the console. 10 numbers, starting at 0, and going to 9 - not including 10. \nIt turns out this little pattern is really common. We have some code that happens before the while loop (labeled A, above). Then some conditional we check every loop (i\u0026lt;10, labeled B). Then some code we run every single time in the loop (labeled C).\nThis pattern is so common, that the programming deities gave us a nicer way to type it out: the for loop.\nThe For Loop #  Actually, the for loop first appeared in ALGOL 58, a programming language developed in 1958, 63 years ago as I type this.  The for loop is simple loop that is much less prone to accidentally writing infinite loops. It\u0026rsquo;s syntax is:\nThe keyword for, followed by three statements inside of the parenthesis, seperated by commas. Then a curly brace containing our loop.\nfor(A;B;C){} The A,B,and C\u0026rsquo;s here match the functionality of the code labeled A,B, and C in the while loop example above.\nThe statements are:\n A: something that happens once at the top of a loop. B: a conditional C: something that happens every loop.  99% of the time we:\n A: Create a variable. int i = 0; B: Compare it to something. A \u0026lt; 10; C: Increment it: i++;  for(int i = 0;i\u0026lt;10;i++) { //do something 10 times, with access to the variable i.  Debug.Log(i); } We always use the variable \u0026ldquo;i\u0026rdquo; for a counter integer. i for iterator.  i++; is shorthand for writing i = i + 1; It\u0026rsquo;s just a little bit tidier. \u0026ldquo;++\u0026rdquo; as an operator will add 1 to the variable to it\u0026rsquo;s left.\nSimilarly, i\u0026ndash; will subtract one from a number.\n "},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/unity/","title":"Unity Development","section":"Docs","content":"Unity Development. #  This section covers non-programming related Unity content.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/programming/","title":"Programming in Unity","section":"Docs","content":"C# Programming In Unity #  See the sidebar for topics.\nExternal Resources:\n Unity Scripting API Microsoft Video Series: C# 101 Jason Weimann Youtube Channel  "},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/programming/fundamentals/arrays/","title":"Arrays","section":"Fundamentals","content":"Arrays #    "},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/programming/fundamentals/classes-and-components/","title":"Classes and Components","section":"Fundamentals","content":"Classes and Components #  Classes are the fundamental building blocks of programming.

We store Assets in the “Assets” folder inside of our unity project folder. Assets are any item in Unity that we may want to use.\nWhen we select an asset in the project window, the Inspector will show us it’s import properties. These are often very important, they tell Unity how to handle the file. For example: fixing scale issues with 3D models.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier to explain assets if we consider their uses.\nCommon Asset Types #  Image Files #  Images, like BMP or Jpeg’s, and even Photoshop documents directly (I haven’t utilized this new feature and still export all my sprites as PNG’s with transparency).\n3D Models #  Unity supports FBX files for your 3D models. It also supports saving your native file format into the asset folder (ie: .max, .blend, .mb, .ma), and Unity turns them into .fbx’s when it runs and builds the game. This is useful if you are going back and forth a lot, but it’s still generally wise to export as FBX, especially if you are sharing/collaborating with others. Keep things from getting too messy.\nSee the unity manual for information on importing models, Model File Formats. Getting textures and animations to import with a model correctly (or to associate these things with models that have already been imported) can be tricky, and I won’t get into the details of this here.\nAudio Files #  Unity supports a wide variety of audio, and will (by default) compress it to when it builds the game. Unity supports mp3, .ogg, .wac, .aif audio files, and\n.mod, .it, .s3m, and .xm tracker modules files.\nIf you don’t know what tracker modules are, don’t worry. Think midi, they are sequence data and short audio samples to build out tracks. This helps create long songs without large file sizes.\nScripts #  As we work in Unity, we will create lots of Scripts. These are C# or JavaScript files. You can make the files from within unity.\nIf you click the **Add Component **in the Inspector and create a **New Script **from here, it will put that script in the base assets folder. Before we open it up in our text editor, we should remember to move it to a Scripts folder, or wherever we want to move it. Unity will keep track of objects that we move around (from within Unity’s project window), but our IDE/text editors may not.  File Structure #  Unity technically doesn’t care where in your project you store your assets. Technically you can have them all just sitting in your assets folder. Don’t do this. Create folders that categorize your asset. Generally based on type. Almost all of my projects have the following folders: “Scripts”, “Materials”, “Models”, “Images”, “Scenes”. Your’s probably should soon.\nThis organization isn’t just to keep things pretty. Unity projects can get complicated quickly, and finding assets is going to be important.\nYou should adopt a standard naming convention for your files, as well. But i won’t yell at you about that. At the very least, keep things descriptive.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/unity/toolbox/clicking-on-objects-in-3d/","title":"Clicking On Objects in 3D","section":"Toolbox","content":"Clicking On Objects in 3D #  Clicking on objects is a non-trivial task, despite how often we implement this behavior.

Objects, on the other hand, are in world-space: they have a position in the scene. Objects in 3D can overlap each other visually. How do we know which one is \u0026ldquo;under\u0026rdquo; the mouse, and only select it?  To solve the first challenge, we need some kind of system to go from screen space to world space. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the camera. Camera\u0026rsquo;s are basically devices to convert from world space to screen space, it\u0026rsquo;s trivial for them to go the other way too! We will get a reference to the camera so we can use functions that the camera provides.\nprivate Camera cam; void Awake(){ cam = Camera.main; } Now that we have that, we need to figure out when we click, and get the mouse coordinates in screen-space: void Update(){ if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { Vector3 mouseScreenPos = Input.mousePosition; } }\nIt\u0026rsquo;s considered good practice to store (aka cache) the \u0026lsquo;Camera.main\u0026rsquo; property in a local variable, because behind-the-scenes, it uses a very slow access method: FindGameObjectWithTag(\u0026ldquo;MainCamera\u0026rdquo;). However, in Unity 2020.2, this was fixed. So it\u0026rsquo;s okay to use now. I\u0026rsquo;ll still use a cached variable here so this example code remains valid for older unity versions.  In order to solve the second part of our challenge, we are going to use the physics system. With this solution, it means that objects we want to click on need colliders. We will create a ray that extends along the cameras point-of-view, from the mouse position, \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; into the scene. Using a raycast means that first thing it hits will be the closest thing to the camera.\nWe will use the cameras ScreenPointToRay function.\nWe also don\u0026rsquo;t really need to store the mousePosition as a temporary Vector3 variable, lets just skip that and plug in the \u0026ldquo;Input.mousePosition\u0026rdquo; directly to this camera function.\nRay ray = cam.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition); Now we need to do a Raycast. I advise you to research Raycasts more, starting with that above documentation page. It uses a C# feature called an \u0026ldquo;out\u0026rdquo; parameter modifier. \u0026ldquo;Out\u0026rdquo; (and \u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo;) allow a function to modify variables that it takes as parameters. That means we have the return type from the function (in this case, a boolean: did we hit anything at all), it has another \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; value - if we did hit something, the data about it is now available in this variable. The \u0026lsquo;out\u0026rsquo; keyword is how we know that this function is allowed to repalce the data in this variable.\nThe RaycastHit datatype is a simple data structure used to get information from the hit. Check out the information it holds in the RaycastHit scriptingAPI documentation.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s put it all together.\nprivate Camera cam; void Awake(){ cam = Camera.main; } void Update(){ if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { Ray ray = cam.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition); RaycastHit hit; if(Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, 100)) { Debug.Log(\u0026#34;clicked on \u0026#34;+hit.collider.gameObject.name); } } } Going Further: Only Clicking Certain Things #  You can use a layer mask to dertermine what you can and cannot click on. LayerMasks are bitmasks, which are annoying to create by hand. If we make one that is serializable, however, it becomes trivially easy to edit in the unity inspector. The Physics.Raycast function takes a layer mask as an argument.\nCreating a layer mask: [SerializeField] private clickableLayerMask;\nAllows us to use the Inspector to select our layer(s): We need to be sure to put the objects we want to select on the layers here, and objects we don\u0026rsquo;t want to select on a different layer.\nWe can then pass this in as an argument in the Raycast funtion. The entire example code now looks like this:\nusing UnityEngine; public class ClickingThings : MonoBehaviour { private Camera cam; [SerializeField] private LayerMask clickableLayerMask; void Awake() { cam = Camera.main; } void Update() { if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { Ray ray = cam.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition); RaycastHit hit; if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, Mathf.Infinity, clickableLayerMask)) { Debug.Log(\u0026#34;clicked on \u0026#34; + hit.collider.gameObject.name); } } } } The only other change is for the raycast distance, I replaced \u0026ldquo;100\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Mathf.Infinity\u0026rdquo;. You probably want to limit the distance of your raycasts to something appropriate as a small optimization.

You can’t delete it, because every gameObject has to have one. An Empty game object still has a position in the scene. It gives objects positions, rotations, and scales. It also handles how objects can be “children” or “parents” of each other.\nThe Default Main Camera in new scenes have three components: Transform, Camera, and Audio Listener.\nProperties #  It’s important to understand the main feature that Components give us: properties. Components add behavior and functionality to GameObjects. Properties makes this useful. We can edit many properties of any GameObject’s component. The position, rotation, and scale values in the Transform component are it’s properties.\nThere are two types of properties: Values and References. Basically, properties are either:\n Values: Data. Numbers. Variables in a script. Any direct value such as booleans, colors, strings, numbers, vectors, and so on. References: Telling us which other thing to use. Such as other GameObjects, other Components, or Assets.  For Example, the audio source component has a volume property, which is a number (a value) telling unity how loud to play the audio, but it also has an AudioClip property. This property is a reference. We point it to an audio file in our assets folder.\nEditing Properties #  Many value properties are just numbers or letters, and editing them is as simple as typing in whatever number we want. Some values, like colors, would be annoying to edit as numbers (do you know the RGBa values for all of the colors you want to use?). Unity gives us special editors for many values. Colors, to continue the example, have a color picker that will be familiar to you if you have used almost any graphics software.\nFor numerical properties, you can change the value by clicking and dragging left/right on the properties label. I find it especially useful to click and drag on the “x”, “y” or “z” text to the left of the value in the Transform component to quickly shuttle objects around the scene without messing up my scene view.\nClicking and dragging on labels can easily adjust numerical properties.\nReference properties look like light grey rectangles and have a small circle to the side of them. We can drag and drop files from our assets (ie: the project window) into here to tell components what thing to use. Audio sources need to know what audio clip, sprite renderer’s need to know what sprite to render, colliders often use physics materials, and so on.\nDragging a Physics Material, from the Project window, onto an appropriate property in the Inspector window\nThe little circle is the Object Picker, which basically lets us not have to drag and drop from the project window, it opens a window with the possible things from our game that the property could be referencing, and we can quickly select them there without navigating around the project window.\nUsing the Object Picker to quickly grab the desired asset.\nRead about how to edit many types of properties in the Unity Manual.\nAdding Components To GameObjects #  With a GameObject selected (Click on it in the Hierarchy or in the Scene view), it’s components are available to be edited in the Inspector Window. In the Inspector window, there is an “Add Component” button at the bottom you can use.\nAdding the rigidbody component to a gameObject in the inspector.\nWithout using the inspector window, you can use the Component menu at the top menu bar to add a component to a selected GameObject.\nA third way to add components to a GameObject is with code. Components can be added and removed during a games run-time.\nMaking Our Own Components #  When we make a script for Unity, most of the time that script will behave as a component. In fact, all components are written in C#, and we can even look at their code. Neat!\nCommon Components #  Other fundamental components we will see in most 3D projects include: Camera, Light, Mesh Filter, Mesh Renderer, Collider Components, and Rigidbody. 2D games can use components for 3D games, but there are also components specific to 2D. Sprite Renderer’s are one example. There are also 2D versions of many components (for performance reasons).\nLets break down something fundamental into the components involved: A Cube.\nA cube has 3 Components.\n Mesh Filter Mesh Renderer Box Collider  You don’t need to worry about the mesh filter. It takes a mesh asset (the file on your computer) and make it usable by the mesh renderer. The specifics of this don’t matter to us. So much that if you add a Mesh Renderer to a GameObject, Unity will automatically add a mesh renderer.\nThe Mesh Renderer makes the mesh visible to the cameras. Look at it’s properties: Cast Shadows (on/off), Recieve Shadows, Materials, light probes, and other graphics jargon. All of it affects how the mesh is seen by the camera, in the scene. Useful!\nThe third component is a Box Collider. This makes the cube solid. Without a collider, the box would just be visible, but unity’s physics system would not be able to calculate if something is colliding with it or not.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/unity/unity-fundamentals/builds/","title":"Creating Builds","section":"Fundamentals","content":"Unity Builds #  Scene Information #  Unity supports a number of \u0026lsquo;Build Targets\u0026rsquo;, or platforms that it can create executable files for. Desktop software for Windows, Mac, and Linux - of course, but also mobile platforms like Android and iOS, WebGL targets for playing games in the web browser on sites like itch.io, and game consoles like the Xbox or the Playstation .\nI will use the terms \u0026lsquo;Build Target\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Platform\u0026rsquo; interchangeably on this page.  The empty rectangle at the top is a list of all of the scenes that will be included in the build. If your scene isn\u0026rsquo;t in this list, Unity will exclude it, and you can\u0026rsquo;t load it. Unity will also do it\u0026rsquo;s best to only include necessary assets in your project, and it uses the scene list to figure out what it does and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need.\nHere is a full build scenes list for an actual game:\nOn the right, you can see the \u0026lsquo;build index\u0026rsquo; of each scene, and reorder the scenes. The scene at the top of the list - build index 0 - will be the first scene to be loaded when the project launches. After that, it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to switch scenes and do what you need to do to play the game.\nUnity can load multiple scenes at a time. In the above example, the game first loads the \u0026ldquo;init\u0026rdquo; scene, which is a small scene that is in charge of loading all of the other scenes. This game has no main menu, the Init scene simply additively loads the UIHUD scene and the first scene of the game. At the end of each level, it unloads the level and loads the next one.\nThis empty \u0026ldquo;init\u0026rdquo; manager scene is a common design pattern in Unity development.\n Switching Platforms #  Unity needs to know what platform it is targeting while working internally. While you can build to multiple platforms, and switch at any time, the currently selected build target will determine how Unity imports assets. For example, Windows builds, Unity internally converts audio files to a .wav format, while on Android it uses .ogg.\nWhen you switch targets, Unity will need to reimport every single asset in your project. For large projects, this can take a long time. It\u0026rsquo;s generally always best to have the appropriate build target selected, and switch to it early on in development.\nYou can always test your app in play mode no matter what your build target is.\nYou switch from the Build Settings menu, simply select the appropriate target and click \u0026lsquo;Switch Platform\u0026rsquo;\nAdding Build Targets #  By default, Unity only supports building an executable file for the same operating system it is installed on. This is because they take up a lot of file space, and are often not needed. In order to build for other operating systems (building for windows from a mac computer, or vise-versa), we need to add more build targets.\nWe add a build target from the Unity Hub. Close any open Unity projects, and go to the Installs section of the Hub. Click the three dots next to the appropriate unity version, and select \u0026lsquo;add modules\u0026rsquo;.\nYou can see what build targets are installed via icons in the Hub.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know better, choose the \u0026ldquo;Mono\u0026rdquo; versions instead of \u0026ldquo;IL2CPP\u0026rdquo;. For the curious, you can read more about IL2CPP from the Unity documentation.  Android Information For Android, you want to be sure to include the checkboxes for SDK, NDK, and JDK tools. These are necessary for android to work, and Unity can download and install them automatically.\nIf you have done android development with other IDEs (like Android Studio or Unreal Engine), you already have the SDK, NDK, and JDK downloaded on your computer somewhere. If this is the case, you can uncheck these sub-check boxes, and not bother downloading it again, but leave \u0026lsquo;Android Build Support\u0026rsquo; Checked.\nYou can set the locations of these tools manually in Unity (not the Unity Hub). Go to Preferences\u0026hellip; \u0026gt; External Tools.\n  Windows Executable Information When you make a build for windows, Unity will prompt you to select a folder. It\u0026rsquo;s standard practice to create a \u0026lsquo;Builds\u0026rsquo; folder in your project, and then a folder for each build in this folder.\nName the folder something appropriate (its smart to number or date your builds, so you never mess up and grab an out-of-date version).\nUnity creates the .exe file, a standalone file. This means we don\u0026rsquo;t have to install the app. All of the information it needs to run is here. It also means you can\u0026rsquo;t just send someone the .exe file. We need to have all of the files - the gameName_data folder, the MonoBleedingEdge folder, and UnityPlayer.dll.\nIf any of these files or folders are missing, the game will throw an error.\nFurther, the .exe filename and the _Data folder name need to match. If you rename one, you have to rename the other too. The executable file looks at its own name and searches for that+ \u0026ldquo;_Data\u0026rdquo; for a folder full of important game data.\nWhen sending this file to someone, or uploading to a site like itch.io, its best to put all the files in a compressed (zip) folder.\n  macOS Executable Information On the build settings menu, there is an\u0026quot;Architecture\u0026quot; drop-down. Choose between Intel, Apple silicon, or \u0026lsquo;both\u0026rsquo;. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know better, select both. This creates a much larger file size than just selecting one or the other, so if you do know the architecture is running (apple silicon includes apple \u0026ldquo;M1\u0026rdquo; devices), you should select it. You can also make multiple builds. If you are hosting your game online for someone to download, you can let them choose the appropriate version for them.\nMac creates a .app file. This single file is everything the game needs to run, no extra folders to worry about including.\nFor someone to run the game, and you aren\u0026rsquo;t worrying about code signing or notarization, they may need to \u0026ldquo;Allow apps downloaded from anywhere\u0026rdquo; in their security and privacy settings. Read more about apple\u0026rsquo;s security practices from apple support.\n  "},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/digital-media-fundamentals/creative-vs-execution/","title":"Creativity vs. Execution","section":"Digital Media Fundamentals","content":"Creative Level Work vs. Execution Level Work #  Let us identify different ways working, which might also call \u0026ldquo;styles of problem solving\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;types of work\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;methods of creative engagement\u0026rdquo;.\nTo start with an example, consider driving. When we all started learning how to drive, we had to think about every little mechanical action we took. Where do my hands go on the wheel. How hard do I press on the break. Is the car between the lines. Am I lined up with the parking space. One has to focus on the specifics of driving, lets call it the \u0026ldquo;execution-level\u0026rdquo; operations. Manipulating the turn, breaking the right way, changing gears. The movement and actions of their hands, the specifics of the cars positions and turning radius. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this kind of stuff \u0026ldquo;execution-level\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you are really focused on this, as novice drivers are, then it becomes very easy to accidentally lose track of the big-picture navigational tasks. Beginners miss their exits way more often than long-time drivers.\nIn this example we would call the big picture stuff \u0026ldquo;navigation\u0026rdquo;, but in creative software we can call it \u0026ldquo;Creative Level\u0026rdquo; work. Thinking about what elements might work in the composition and trying different things out, for example. The feedback and execution loop of iterating on an idea.\nCreative software has a lot of execution-level things. While you are using software, identify times where you focused on the creative level, and on the execution level, and try not to do both at the same time.\n Avoid attempting to focus on execution-level and creative-level tasks at the same time.\n That\u0026rsquo;s the big takeaway from this essay.\nThis means, when learning how to do something, where you really need to focus on your button-clicks, the technical process; you should try working in a sandbox - a free experimentation area. This way you can freely dive into that execution-level work and practice it, without having to worry about the larger project.\nThen, when doing the creative-level things, try to stick to the execution stuff you are confident you know how to do. When you get an idea that you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do, make note of it. Try not to interupt your creative-level task to immedeatly go research and explore that, unless it\u0026rsquo;s truly blocking you. In which case, ackgnowlege that this is an interuption. Then completely switch your focus, research/practice fully and appropriatley, and then switch back to your process. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to multitask.\n In 3D software, I often work with multiple software windows open, one just a playground that I won\u0026rsquo;t even save. By the time I reach the end of a Unity project, I have to go delete a good handful of \u0026ldquo;testingScene\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;mechanicTest\u0026rdquo; scene files. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to reach the end of an audio composition without a couple tracks that are muted and will stay that way, which I can probably safely delete by now.\n A big problem that students have is being forced into working on both learning how to do something, and deciding what to do at the same time. There are some nasty feedback loops where their ideas are constrained by their perceived abilities. It makes time management really hard!\nThe solution? First, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any magic bullets here. You need to practice. Focused practice, where you work on a specific technique, or specific type of creative prompt. Next, of course, is to produce a large body of work. Make lots of little things, and get experience with a wide variety of techniques.\nThat advice is annoying, so I have some more pragmatic advice too.\nThe Pragmatic Advice #  Give yourself time to research #  Learn in a learning phase, then apply it. The extreme version, which I recommend, is to do projects where you go as slow as possible. and you don\u0026rsquo;t care about the outcome. Just research the execution level of every little thing as you come accross it. Don\u0026rsquo;t do every project like that, but occasionally, just dive into the tool for the sake of learning the tool.\nMore pragmatic versions of that approach are good too, depending on your timelines. Give yourself the time to engage in this way.\nPlayground/Sketchbook #  Artists, painters, and photographers all know the importance of keeping a sketchbook, be it literally or proverbially.\nBut programmers? They somehow never got the memo. Well, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you now: Not everything you create needs to be finished. Not everything you create needs to be usable. You need to engage with your workflows in order to develop them. You need to isolate the part of your workflows you are weak at, and practice those.\n Doing every project to completion is not an efficient way to learn. It\u0026rsquo;s the least efficient way to learn.\n If a guitarist is stuck on a certain type of chord progression, they don\u0026rsquo;t practice the whole song over and over again start to finish. Yeah, sounds obvious in this metaphor. So keep a sketchbook, focus on things you are bad at, and just mess around.\nTo do that, you need the freedom to work in an environment where not everything you create needs to be published, and not everything you do will end up being, say, graded. In an academic environment, it will take work to create this environment for yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to work on ungraded practice while graded deadlines loom. I recommend creating consistent scheduled practice time. Setting aside time consistently makes it easier to schedule your other tasks around it. Think of a musicians who have their regular practice hours. They know they need it to improve and stay sharp, and you do too.\nReference and Objectives #  When you are in a piece of software, and tied up on execution level stuff, it really helps to have a clear objective. It free\u0026rsquo;s you from having to do creative/iterative things.\nInstead - plan out ahead of time what you will try to make. Sketch out your thing on a piece of paper, then scan it into your painting or 3D modeling software, or whatever parellel is appropriate. Open up lots and lots of reference images/sound/whatever, so when you have a clear objective to reference. \u0026ldquo;I want this to look/sound like that\u0026rdquo;.\nBasically, you are bypasing the part of the artistic process where you have to have a highly developed mental model of what you are creating. Developing and working on creating mental model is the creative-level things. Let\u0026rsquo;s put it aside for the time-being.\n Post-it notes are the best invention of all time. I\u0026rsquo;ll sketch a little 3D model with almost no deatail on a post-it note, and stick it to my monitor. It keeps you focused and prevents you from iterating on creative things in random directions. (That sudden inspiration is cool and good, but do you really have time right now?).\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also draw a little flow chart of my code architecture.or photography, I keep track of my checklist of what looks (images) I will need to deliever when editing a full session. Keep your goals in mind. It will help you prioritize.\n Take Notes As You Work #  I want you to think like a coach, analyzing their players playing, and writing little notes on their clipboard. What elements should the players focus on during practice?\n Back when I played Ice Hockey, our coach dedicated a third of our practices to penalty kills, which is an insane ratio. But our coach knew the numbers because they took notes (whole stat spreadsheets, in fact) - we got a lot of pentalties. Sure enough, we got good at penalty kills, and ended up winning more games despite the penalties. (Yes, we also needed to work on not getting caught by the ref so often. I mean playing cleaner).\n Becoming proficient in a piece of software means being able to work in the creative space, because you aren\u0026rsquo;t really thinking about your tool. You are thinking \u0026ldquo;Maybe this image would look better desaturated. Hmm, no, maybe not.\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;Where is the adjustment layers window again. Should I use a saturation adjustment or a black-and-white adjustment layer with low opacity. What\u0026rsquo;s the difference?\u0026rdquo;. Identify times you got taken out of the creative space, and make note. (You can write a note on a post-it. (\u0026ldquo;Parenting things in blender, wtf\u0026rdquo;) When you have more time, go research. You will be learning exactly the things that have been slowing you down.\nYou need to be your own coach. Nobody else is doing it. Keep a piece of paper (or whatever - how I love software that lets you keep little text notes right inside them) - and just jot down something that got you stuck, or that you spent time on. Once it\u0026rsquo;s written down, you\u0026rsquo;ve free\u0026rsquo;d it from your mind, and don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about it until later, when you look over your list and go \u0026ldquo;yep yep, time to figure out the whole parent/child process\u0026rdquo;. Then do that. For example, maybe you finally just memorize the syntax of a for loop.\n Students, this is why I prioritize so much time to in-class workshops, and send you to places like this website for lectures and learning. It\u0026rsquo;s called the \u0026ldquo;flipped classroom\u0026rdquo; pedagogy, and it allows me to give you better feedback of the actual little things that are tripping you up, and hard to research. To stay on-metaphor, it lets me be a software coach.\n  "},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/programming/architecture/data-oriented-design-scriptable-objects/","title":"Data-Oriented Design with Scriptable Objects","section":"Architecture","content":"Data-oriented Design #  I think one of the best introductions to pragmatic data-oriented design is the 2017 talk that Ryan Hipple gave at the Unity Connect conference.

Different projects require different workflows, and identifying this is often challenging for beginners.\nGenerally: work out a draft and refine. What constitutes draft? What elements are refinement? What is neccesary for understanding core, fundamental, parts of your project?\nIn animation, One doesn\u0026rsquo;t animate Start to finish, timing is a key part or animation, so the animator starts with notable moment poses, and timings, and places key frames first, then they go add the ih between frames, after spending time tweaking the timing. You need to find the \u0026ldquo;key frames\u0026rdquo; of your project, and get those down before worrying about the metaphorical \u0026ldquo;in-betweens\u0026rdquo;.\nA digital painter does not paint element by element.

Thus, you want to save that detail work for later in the progress.\nFor whatever tool or workflow, the goals involve minimizing work and maximizing iteration and feedback.\nWhen a sculpter makes a statue out of marble, it would be rediculous for them to go top-down, such that they never go back to a previous area twice. This is obvious! Yet for whatever reason, programmers never seemed to think this applies to them. \u0026ldquo;Refinining a script? That just means you didn\u0026rsquo;t write it well enough the first time!\u0026rdquo;. This thinking is absurd. Hey programmers: stop implementing subsystems before you have your core gameplay working.\nDetermining What Goes First #  Have some kind of plan or concept in mind. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I need to say this, but that\u0026rsquo;s where it starts. Don\u0026rsquo;t just open the software and start clicking.\nFrontload large parts of the project that will change and affect other elements. Sketch it out first.\nDetermine what elements are blocked. Are there discreet stages to development? Working non-destructively can\u0026rsquo;t always be avoided, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to refine your print-making process before you\u0026rsquo;ve got your negatives developed how you wan them.\nPrioritize The Feedback You Need #  The less you have to do before looking at it and going \u0026ldquo;hmmmm\u0026rdquo;, the better.\nFor animators, start with the timing and poses.\nFor game developers, focus on the core game loop. Animating the character, nice particle effects, implementing audio - none of that matters until you have your tight core gameplay.\nBypass Intuition #  Level design starts with a block out. Music starts as loose sketches and loops. A painting begins with a sketch. Better artists don\u0026rsquo;t need better intuition, they work in a way that lets them visualize early and visualize often. They bypass the need for intuition. By being smarter about where they focus their attention. They put things on the \u0026lsquo;page\u0026rsquo; that are difficult to imagine (visualize), and test those first. Artists are always frontloading iteration, talented artsists make working easier on themselves.\nA character design doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be inked and colored before the artist understands if the pose and propotions are correct.\nBut this is true in less obvious cases than a drawing. In game design, you really need to start with the core game loop, the fundamental elements to the players' experience. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress enough how important it is to get gameplay to be fun before you make it look good or be bug-free. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a brilliant genious able to imagine complex interactions of systems, you just need to be able to make prototypes, give and take feedback, and iterate.\nPrioritize Things that Affect Others #  Do the big things that affect other things first.\nIn a game, this might mean implementing your core gameplay manager before implementing your audio manager. Not because the audio manager is less important, but because the design decisions of other systems probably don\u0026rsquo;t care how the audio manager is implemented. But the design decisions of many systems (incuding the audio manager) probabyl cares about, say, how your event system is implemented. So do those earlier.\nThis obvious advice often gets ignored because it\u0026rsquo;s hard to make a decision about something precisely because it affects so much else, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to work on some compartmentalized subsystem with confidence that you won\u0026rsquo;t be messing up your future-self and re-doing work.\nEven with the most cleanly architected systems, you need to just accept that you will have to re-do some work, budget some time to let that happen, and just get started on the big stuff early.\nGet External Feedback Early #  Getting feedback from outside sources is self-explanatory, but only possible when you work in an appropriate order.\n"},{"id":27,"href":"/docs/unity/3d-models/rig-with-mixamo/","title":"Setting up a Rig with Mixamo","section":"3D Models","content":"Setting up a Rig with Mixamo #  This is an older video, I promise some useful information is hidden in there somewhere.\nThe video got demonitized (it was never monitized) because of an automatic copywrite claim by Katy Perry.

See the unity manual on the Game View.\nFirst, our scene view camera and our game view camera are two completely separate things. The scene view, and its \u0026lsquo;camera\u0026rsquo; that you control with the mouse, is an editor tool. The camera\u0026rsquo;s location has no impact on the final, finished, game. The game view, then, allows us to see the games current actual state, how it will be rendered.\nWhen you are in play mode, the game view is where we play and test the game. When we are not in play mode, we can get a preview of the active cameras current view, which is helpful for setting up the camera, UI, and other things.\nIn the game view we get to see what actually happens in the game when we test it. It shows us what players will ultimately see.\nIt’s very important to know that while the game is running, any changes we make will not be saved. At first, this can seem frustrating, but it’s for a good reason: The game is running!\nPlayers playing the game are also making changes to properties (like the position of a main character), and it would be really annoying if we had to move them back to the start of a level after every time we tested it.\nEvery beginner will start adjusting settings and forget that Unity is “in play mode” (running the game), and then they will lose their changes.
