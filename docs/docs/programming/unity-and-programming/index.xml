      <description>Unity Collision Events #  Overview Video #  A (slow) video walking through setup and common mistakes for using collision events.
  Example #  A really common pattern when using collision events is to check if the thing we hit has a certain tag, or has a certain component.
GetComponent is slower than using CompareTag, so we prefer that - however, it can quickly become impractical.

After looking through this high-level-overview page, I recommend reading this page on Vectors in the Unity manual.
Vector Overview #    Types of Vectors in Unity #  In Unity, we have a number of different &amp;lsquo;vector&amp;rsquo; data structures:
 Vector2 Vector3 Vector4  The number refers to the number of floats that the vector contains.</description>
